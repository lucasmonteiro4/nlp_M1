# Natural Language Processing M1

This is a group project realised during my first year of Master degree in Statistics and Econometrics

The subject was about natural language processing, fitting distributions and poissons mixtures

We considered 4 distributions : Poisson, Negative binomial, 2-Poisson and K-Mixture (Katz)

My part : Graphs of Question 1    /    Question 2 - K-Mixture     /     Question 3     /     Question 4 K-Mixture     /     Question 5
